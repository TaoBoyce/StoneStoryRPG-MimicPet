written by Bitty45
art by Tag
version 1.0.0

A mimic friend to bounce alongside you!
To use it, you simply need to import it (see stonescript manual on importing)
This version requires BouncingPetBase and won't work without it.
If you're on mobile, sorry! Check out the version that doesn't use BouncingPetBase.

in the mindstone, to change the color or anything else, you can do this:
var Mimic=import MimicPet_Using_BouncingPetBase
var MimicBase = Mimic.PetBase
MimicBase.PET_COLOR = #ffffff
MimicBase.Main()
*/

var PetBase = new BouncingPetBase

//EDITABLE VALUES=======================
PetBase.PET_COLOR = #rainFF
PetBase.MAX_DIST = 15 //triggers a jump if X is farther than this
PetBase.MIN_DIST = 3 //how close it will try to jump to the player
PetBase.MAX_JUMP = 5 //how high it will jump
PetBase.MAX_Z_DIST = 5 //triggers a jump if Z is farther than this
//what percent it will travel towards targetX per frame, min of 1 char
PetBase.MOVE_PERCENT = 0.10

PetBase.PRINT_X_OFFSET = 4 //offsets the print, should be about the width of the art
PetBase.PRINT_Y_OFFSET = -1 //offsets the print, should be about the height of the art
PetBase.JUMP_ANIM_PERCENT = 0.4 //what percent it will hold the jump animation
PetBase.PEAK_ANIM_PERCENT = 0.6 //what percent it will hold the peak animation
//fall animation is what percent is left over
